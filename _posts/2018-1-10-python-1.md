During the lesson, we were formally introduced to Python. We revisited some old concepts, and we were shown the ideas and creativity were rewarded instead of the syntax itself. We started on the “print” statement, a way of printing something to the console. We explored its syntax, and how you could use it. Since I had some previous experience with Python, I used this time to catch up and remember most of the built and functions and syntax while making a simple password script, and expanding on it. 

During this time, I also noticed the similarity with FUZE Basic, perhaps Basic is based of off Python?
