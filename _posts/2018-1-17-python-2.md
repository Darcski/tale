Before the next lesson started, I was practicing a bit at home, mostly looking over modules. I hadnâ€™t touched Python for a while, so I thought it was a good idea to revise the syntax. The start of the lesson was similar to the previous, we revisited some concepts and were shown basic programs, then told to make our own. Personally, I spent this time finishing my password program, which I had added more features to. Mister Keen looked over my work, and suggested using .txt files instead of tables. I would imagine in a real database, it would make it more secure and if it was encrypted, even more so. I spent the rest of the lesson reading and writing files, and exploring the possibilities.
