In the lesson, I was mainly working on different bits of code from Google Drive, using old StackOverflow posts and the wiki when I was 
stuck; it was mainly a remembering process. In class we went over variables, printing and functions, which I recognised from other languages (including FUZE). There wasn't really 
much to this lesson, it was really only an introduction to the syntax.

After the lesson, I stayed at IT club to continue with codeacademy, and the code on google drive.
