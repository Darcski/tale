In this lesson, we learned Python with turtle. In basic terms, it is Python - but with drawings. In Repl, there are two screens - a blank one, and the normal output. When using normal python, the output showed up, but the other screen was mysteriously blank. Later in the lesson, Mr Keen said we had to import the turtle module before starting to use this blank screen. Knowing this, I could change the appearance of the turtle, its colour and speed. Using the turtle was very simple, there are four basic commands: turtle.forward(), turtle.right(), turtle.left(), turtle.circle(). All of these are pretty self explanatory. We spent the rest of the lesson making a shape generator - creating any shape provided you give it a number of sides.

In conclusion, it was a very useful lesson.
