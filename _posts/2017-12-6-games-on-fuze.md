At the beginning of the lesson, we finished our work on light detectors. We were about to move on to the next activity, when we 
were told to Snake on the FUZE Boxes. I hadn't really thought about making games on the FUZE Boxes before, though I did have a few
ideas about how it was done (i.e defchars, and having different keys to change the hvtab).

Before I did this however, I made a few changes to my blog. First and foremost, I changed the entire theme to a more plain and simple one, which made the page less cluttered and easier to navigate through. Secondly, I changed my background to be a bit more 
detailed, but still plain enough to create contrast between the the text and background.

It turned out we already had the game on our FUZE Box, ready to play. I was surprised (and impressed!) by the quality of the game, I could never imagine making something like that. Looking through the code on the school website made it a bit easier to understand however. We spent the rest of the lesson copying the code, afterwards looking through it and finding out why it worked, and how it synergised with the other blocks of code on the website.

Afterwards we took a look at other games on the FUZE Box, and I was just as impressed with those as with Snake. It's quite refreshing to know that there are so many different things you can do with the boxes.
